# Roadmap for Improvements in the "Environment" Directory

## 1. Enhance the GameEnvironment Script

- **Dynamic Weather System:** Implement a system that simulates changing weather conditions, affecting gameplay and player interactions.

- **Day-Night Cycle:** Develop a day-night cycle that influences visibility, NPC behavior, and SCP activities.

- **Environmental Audio:** Integrate audio effects that correspond to different weather conditions and times of day.

- **Performance Optimization:** Ensure that environmental updates are efficient and do not impact game performance.

## 2. Refine the Injury System

- **Expand Injury Types:** Add more injury types and severity levels to cover a wider range of scenarios.

- **Localized Injuries:** Implement a system where injuries affect specific body parts, influencing gameplay mechanics like movement or item handling.

- **Dynamic Injury Effects:** Make injury effects evolve over time, worsening if untreated and gradually healing when treated.

- **Visual and Audio Feedback:** Introduce specific animations and sound effects for different injuries.

## 3. Develop a Comprehensive Status Effect System

- **Expand Status Effect Types:** Include additional status effects like hallucinations or radiation sickness.

- **Severity Levels for Effects:** Introduce varying severity levels for each status effect, affecting gameplay differently.

- **Countermeasures and Treatments:** Allow players to use specific items or actions to counteract or treat status effects.

- **Environmental Interactions:** Make certain environmental conditions exacerbate or alleviate specific status effects.

## Implementation Strategies

- **Collaboration with Design and Art Teams:** Work closely with the design and art teams to ensure that environmental changes, injuries, and status effects are visually and audibly represented in the game.

- **Iterative Development and Testing:** Implement features iteratively, starting with basic mechanics and gradually adding complexity. Regularly test for bugs, balance, and player feedback.

- **Utilize Modular Design:** Design systems in a modular fashion, allowing for easy expansion and modification in the future.

- **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the game's performance, especially when implementing resource-intensive features like dynamic weather or day-night cycles.

- **Player Feedback Integration:** Regularly gather and integrate player feedback to refine and adjust the mechanics for an optimal gaming experience.

- **Documentation and Comments:** Maintain comprehensive documentation and comments within the code for clarity and ease of future modifications.
